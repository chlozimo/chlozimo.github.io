I'm a third year biochemistry student and I have been involved with Dr. Costanzo's organic synthesis research the last two and a half years here at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. My interest in polymer chemistry led me to be selected as the 2021 Phillips Space Scholar and I worked at the Space Vehicles Directorate at the Air Force Research Laboratory.
