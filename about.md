Since my first quarter at Cal Poly, I have had the privilege of working alongside Dr. Phillip Costanzoâ€™s polymer chemistry research team. The work I did during my first year distinguished me enough to be awarded the William Frost Scholarship to continue my work over the summer of 2020. My interest in polymer chemistry led me to be selected as the 2021 Phillips Space Scholar and I worked at the Space Vehicles Directorate for the Air Force Research Laboratory. This next summer, I will be doing a REU at Cornell University as part of the CSP program. I'm excited to continue to refine my synthesis skills and expand my capabilites as a researcher and thinker.
